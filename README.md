## HOW TO USE

### To start monitoring

    CrossGeofences.Current.StartMonitoring(new GeofenceRegion( 
        "My House", // identifier - must be unique per registered geofence
        Center = new Position(LATITUDE, LONGITUDE), // center point    
        Distance.FromKilometers(1) // radius of fence
    ));

### Wire up to notifications

    CrossGeofences.Current.RegionStatusChanged += (sender, args) => 
    {
        args.State // entered or exited
        args.Region // Identifier & details
    };

### Stop monitoring a region
    
    CrossGeofences.Current.StopMonitoring(GeofenceRegion);

    or

    CrossGeofences.Current.StopAllMonitoring();


### FAQ

* Q) Why create another geofence plugin

  A) I felt like the integration or bloat in other geofence libraries (stay, notifications, etc). I also didn't like that Google Play Services were required in Android which required your device to be online when creating the geofences.  This did not work with my requirements

* Q) Why use a cross platform GPS library for Android?
  
  A) James has done a ton of work around the Android geolocation mess.  I didn't want to duplicate this.  I just wanted to attach to an event and set the desired accuracy

* Q) Yes, but what about google play services?

  A) The amount of code necessary to register a geofence as well as all of the junk that came with it made it annoying and no less of a drain on the battery
